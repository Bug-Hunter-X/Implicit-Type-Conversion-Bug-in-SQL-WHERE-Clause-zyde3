The following SQL query contains a subtle bug related to data type handling and implicit conversion:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = '123';
```

This query might fail or return unexpected results if the `employee_id` column is defined as an integer type (e.g., `INT`, `BIGINT`).  The problem is the comparison between an integer column and a string literal. Many database systems will attempt implicit type conversion, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the conversion fails or produces unintended results.  For example, if the database tries to convert '123' to an integer and encounters a value like 'abc' in the `employee_id` column (which could occur due to data inconsistencies), it will fail.

Another issue might arise if the `employee_id` column is very large. Comparing an integer with a string can result in different behaviour than comparing integers. This may not result in an error in some database systems but it may lead to unexpected results.
